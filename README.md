awesomepress
=======

A plugin to let you use Font Awesome (http://fontawesome.io) without editing your WordPress theme.

Allow for shortcode usage with:

`[fa font="FONT_NAME"]`

### Setup

Download as a zip, install via wordpress admin. Or submodule.

### Warning

When using with WordPress do not name the folder 'awesomepress' - there is an existing plugin with the
same name that will try to update this plugin. I suggest using the downloaded name "awesomepress-master"
from GitHub.
